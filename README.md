# Rock, Paper, Scissors!

This is a very simple rock, paper and scissors game we created at the end of week 1 at the School of Code.


To play, simply clone the repo to your local drive, right click on the index.html file and open it with chrome or your browser of choice and then follow the game prompt to play a game of rock paper and scissors vs the Computer.
